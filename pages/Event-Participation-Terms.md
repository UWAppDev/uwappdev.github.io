For participants in this organization's events, please read the following terms.

# Terms
Thank you for your interest in participating in App Development Club (the "RSO")'s events ("Event(s)").

Please read these Event Participation terms (the “Terms”) carefully because they are the agreement between you and the RSO. By joining the Discord server of the RSO or participating in any of the Events, you confirm that you understand and agree to these Terms.

The RSO may change these Terms from time to time. Revised Terms will be posted on the community Wiki.

## Meeting Conduct

While Events have different purposes, all Event organizers, RSO members, and attendees should maintain a friendly, safe, supportive, and harassment-free environment and follow posted and/or applicable event guidelines, including the [Community Code of Conduct]({{ 'pages/Code-of-Conduct' | relative_url }}).

Unacceptable behavior(s) will not be tolerated. Anyone engaged in unacceptable behavior(s) may be exited from the RSO, Events, or resources, including future Event participation. Unacceptable behavior may also result in prohibition from registering for or attending future RSO Events.

## Assumption of Risk

Your participation in and attendance of an Event or any related activities is completely voluntary. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, you accept and assume all risks of any and all personal injury or damage to your personal property that you may face while attending an Event or related activities, and waive any claims against the RSO and/or RSO members relating to such risks.

## Photo, Video, and Other Media

Event organizers, RSO members, other Event attendees and/or the RSO may photograph, record (both audio and video), webcast, podcast during an Event. Your image, likeness, voice, statements, and other identifying characteristics may be captured and transmitted as a result. By attending and participating in an Event where such recording is taking place, as well as agreeing to these Terms, you authorize the recording and agree that the RSO may use such recorded content for any purpose without compensation to you.

## Email Settings

By joining an Event you may receive service-related emails regarding your participation in the event and related activities. We will never share your email with 3rd parties.
