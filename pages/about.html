                                We teach each other to develop mobile apps! Every Thursday, we give a presentation on
                                some portion of a mobile framework. Tuesdays, more expierenced members are available
                                during meeting times to answer questions.

                            <div>
                                Although we have given presentations covering other frameworks, we focus on Flutter and
                                SwiftUI. If you are interested in learning another framework
                                we encourage you to learn it and share what you have learned with the club!
                                Propose a presentation on a framework through our <a href = "https://discord.gg/ZyDM5Br">Discord!</a>
