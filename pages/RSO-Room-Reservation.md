title: RSO Room Reservation
---

> (Not so) fun fact: the RSO has a significant negative balance because we didn't know how to reserve a free room for 12 hours on campus. We still don't.
>
> Also we are looking for someone that can join the Board and fix the current financial situation :pray:

```diff
- Important: 

Carefully review the room capacity and other restrictions.
