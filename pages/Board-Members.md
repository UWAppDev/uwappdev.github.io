## Responsibilities and Expectations

To provide equal access of information to all, the App Development Club shall refrain from actions and methods of broadcasts that unnecessarily exclude certain demographics or individuals from accessing information released and announced by the RSO (examples against this clause include but are not limited to making announcements solely to major and department-specific communication mailing-lists and other communication groups OR to explicitly state or conduct outreach in a fashion that suggests that the RSO is "exclusive to people in computing").

To ensure that all are welcomed at the App Development Club, the RSO shall maintain an open, free, and neutral stance on the freedom of expression. RSO meetings and gatherings are expected to follow the rough topics of discussion as outlined by the agenda and the material presented. However, no **forceful** attempts shall be made to restrict the will to express of any individual or entity present.

## Doomsday Plan

If one day the RSO no longer exists at the University of Washington, interested students may look at this Wiki, see what went wrong, and revive it. You should get access to appdev@uw.edu through Student Activities Office, then check Google Drive for additional records and accounts we had.

However, let's work together to make sure the RSO can thrive to serve its purpose for many years to come.
